1)Java Script is an programming language used in the browser to manipulate the DOM    1)runtime Environment of javascript outside the browser
and CSSCOM

2)it uses the respective  JS engines of browser like for chrome it is V8 engine       2)it uses the V8 engine of the chrome 
and for firefox it is spidermonkey

3)web application to have serverside with them and javascript used to create          3)it is used to develop Backend services applications
content and request HTTP

4)generally to create Network applications                                            4)it is used to create cross platform applications

5)Not all javaSCript application are Node.js apps                                     5)All node.js applications are Javascript apps



Q.2)summary of ryan seddon video of JSconf:

1)every Web browser has an rendering machine and Js engine
2)rendering machine contains HTML parser and CSSCOM parser html parser creates the DOM tree and css parser performs the CSSCOM tree
3)every HTML program follow through an definite order of <body> to </body> then <elements> to <elements> and thier decleration
4)CSS tree follows the same path of throught going through the selectors and decleration
(eg) style.h1==> selector  { colour:"red"} ==>decleration
5)java Sript engine manipulates both the html and css parser
6)it is best to place script at the end of body for faster rendering 




Q.3)code execution and thier description

1)typeof(1)                        output:number

Description:
Numbers are primitive datatypes used to perform the logical operations,mathematical operations

2)typeof(1.1)                      output:number

Description:
it is a type of float Number are primitive datatypes used to perform the logical operations,mathematical operations

3)typeof('1.1')                    output:string

Description:
strings are primitive data type used in Javascript to store data and they used with the syntax of "...."
(eg)- "strings"

4)typeof(true)                    output:boolean

Description:
booleans are used to find wether the given condition is statisfied or not
(eg) program to print wether the given number is odd or even 
let number=9
if(a%2==0)
{
console.log("even number")
}else
{
console.log("odd number")
}

output:odd number

5)typeof(null)                     output:object

Description:
Null is an type of object that is equal to null==undefined gives true

6)typeof(undefined)                output:undefined

Description:
undefined is type comes while calling an variable that is declared without any assigning value and (undefined==null =>true)

eg- let a
    console.log(a)   output:undefined

7)typeof([])                        output:object

Description:
the given data type is array but in javascript it is an part of object

8)typeof({})                        output:object

Description:
objects are used in the form of key:value format to store information or data in javascript

9)typeof(NaN)                       output:number

Description: 
NaN is defined as not an number it is given when an string and number are subtracted as it is not possible 
(eg)-code
let a=5
let b="ram"
c=a-b
console.log(c)                       output:NaN
